        "Numerical integration is a cornerstone of computational mathematics, enabling the approximation of definite integrals for functions where analytical solutions are either intractable or unavailable. These methods are critical in fields ranging from physics and engineering to economics and data science, where integrals often represent quantities such as areas, volumes, or accumulated effects over time. Common numerical integration techniques, such as the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule, approximate the area under a curve by discretizing the integration interval into simpler geometric shapes, such as trapezoids or parabolic segments. While these methods are well-established, their implementation and verification can be time-consuming, particularly when ensuring accuracy across diverse functions or when teaching these concepts to students.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for automating and enhancing mathematical computations. LLMs, such as those developed by OpenAI or DeepSeek, are trained on vast datasets of text and code, enabling them to understand mathematical problems, generate executable code, and provide natural language explanations. In the context of numerical integration, an LLM-based agent can interpret problem statements (e.g., “Compute the integral of $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ from 0 to 1”), produce Python code for numerical methods, and verify results by comparing them to analytical solutions or high-precision numerical tools like SciPy’s quad function. This capability not only streamlines computation but also serves as an educational tool, offering step-by-step explanations that enhance understanding of numerical methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project develops an LLM-powered AI agent to solve and verify numerical integration problems using the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule. The agent leverages the DeepSeek API, a cost-effective alternative to other LLM APIs, to parse mathematical problems, generate Python code, and explain the results. We test the agent on a dataset of mathematical functions with known analytical integrals, including polynomials, trigonometric functions, and exponentials. By comparing the agent’s results to analytical solutions and established numerical methods, we evaluate its accuracy and reliability. The project also explores the broader implications of LLMs in computational mathematics, particularly their potential to automate complex tasks and assist in educational settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation for this project stems from the intersection of numerical methods and artificial intelligence, both of which are central to modern scientific computing. Numerical integration, as taught in MAT 421, requires a deep understanding of mathematical theory, algorithmic implementation, and error analysis. By integrating LLMs, we aim to demonstrate how AI can augment traditional numerical methods, making them more accessible and efficient. The project aligns with the course’s focus on numerical methods while showcasing the innovative application of LLMs, as explored in related coursework on neural networks and AI agents (e.g., “Neural Networks and AI Agents Powered by Large Language Models” [2]).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following sections, we detail the mathematical foundations of the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule, describe the implementation of the LLM agent, present the dataset used for testing, and discuss the results. This work contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted mathematics, offering a practical example of how LLMs can enhance the study and application of numerical methods."

These methods approximate the definite integral $\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx$, which represents the area under the curve of a function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$. Both methods are widely used in computational mathematics due to their simplicity and effectiveness, and they serve as the core techniques implemented by the LLM agent in this project. Below, we derive the formulas for each method, explain their numerical approximations, and analyze their error characteristics.\n",
