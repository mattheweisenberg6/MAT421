        "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational tools presents a significant opportunity to enhance mathematics learning. Despite the power of models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, there remains a critical gap in their application for step-by-step numerical methods instruction. Current LLMs often provide final answers without proper verification or explanation of intermediate steps, limiting their educational value.\n",
        "This project aims to develop specialized LLM agents that can not only solve numerical problems but also verify solutions, explain how to get to the solution, and adapt to different student learning styles. These agents will serve as intelligent tutoring systems that bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application of numerical methods.\n",
        "The key challenges that will be addressed include ensuring mathematical accuracy and solution verification, providing personalized, step-by-step explanations, creating an interactive learning experience that reinforces conceptual understanding, and developing a system that helps students build intuition for numerical methods."
